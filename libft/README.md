Milestone 1 of 42 Beirut Core

This project serves to help students understand the logic and algorithms behind standard functions everyone uses, whether in C or in higher-level languages like Python.
This project is a great starting point if you want to understand the foundations of coding. It is beneficial for non-technical people wanting to learn about coding and development, as well as university students or junior developers who want to know more about how their code actually works the way it does. 

Follow along this journey to rediscover the tech world together :)
