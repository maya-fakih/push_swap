This is the 1st day working on push swap as a team mfakih and mitani.

This paper will document all the needed algorithms and
stategies needed to understand the push_swap project such that
you will be able to reinmplement it in your way.
I will cover the most important algorithms and how to do each one in theory 
which will be different than how you would go about it in code.

I will also use this opportuinity to document my own progress through this
project. Sharing my interpretation of the subject, the ideas i tried, the issues
i faced and how we came to solve it.

Each section will be titled with the date of that day and every subsection will clearly 
demonstrate the next task at hand we are working on.

Understanding the subject:
This is probably the most complicated part of any project, so we must go over it clearly to avoid
any future confusion. This part will also decide most if not all the approaches to go about this project.

After thorough reading of the subject I came to the following conclusions:
1. parsing string inputs to linked lists
2. the linked lists should be double sided why? well ig it can be useful later but we can start with one sided
3. set up proper add and delete functions to this linked  list
4. write the operations neatly
5. test these steps sepeately for leaks using valgrind
6. the algorithms are still work in process but i will attach a chat history of my mental warzones with gpt for reference
7. after all operations are done we need functions that clean up
8. they should free all lists and return a sungle string of operations seperated by \n only

Now tmrw is a new day and a new mind to think with for now have a great rest of the night.
i will see you in the morning. Goodnight.

To continue on the plan we started yesterday we should define the i/o of this project
The program shall take as input a string of numbers seperated by a space (purely numeric)
the output should be a list of operations seperated by a \n.
There fore we can conclude that we will need a split function to parse the input
and a join function to generate the output format.
we will also need a function to validate the input to be purely a 2d array of numbers

now we can start by the basics probably we will not need all of libft but learning to integrates is a good idea
(espessially learning how to create a makefile that compiles libft and then uses it to compile push_swap)

First we should create the linked list structure.
In our case we will be using the same structure from libft which is why we
added it into the project directory and will be compiling it in the make file 
(check the makefile for more details)

Then we will build the operations in a file operations.c
feel free to use this repository for inspiration but avoid copying codes as that will not be beneficial on the long return
Below i will list each operation, describe its work and explain a structure of which it can be coded.

In order to keep track of norminette we will make sure that we only have 5 functions/file
which is why we will create an operations files described as operations.c 
swap/rotate/rev_rotate.

The 1st file swap_ops.c will include the functions sa sb and ss, such that
sa (swap a): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack a.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
in order to do that we shall 
sb (swap b): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack b.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time

the 2nd file push_ops
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty

the 3rd file
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by one.
The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by one.
The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by one.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by one.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

now upon further inspection of the operations it is very clear that we only need 4 functions
swap:
swaps the 1st 2 elements of any list
we send it either a or b or we call it twice thus ss

push:
pushes the 1st element from lst 1 to lst 2 so it takes 2 argumens
lst1 lst2 based on the order of sending stack_a stack_b we get pb 
whereas sending the arguments as stack_b stack_a it will act as pa

rotate:
removes the top element of the list to the btm of it

rev_rotate:
removes the last element of the list to its top

So overall we will have these possible combinations to represent the operations as needed
// Swap operations
// sa : swap top 2 of stack a       -> swap(&stack_a);
// sb : swap top 2 of stack b       -> swap(&stack_b);
// ss : swap top 2 of both stacks   -> swap(&stack_a); swap(&stack_b);

// Push operations
// pa : push top of b to a          -> push(&stack_b, &stack_a);
// pb : push top of a to b          -> push(&stack_a, &stack_b);

// Rotate operations
// ra : shift up all elements of a  -> rotate(&stack_a);
// rb : shift up all elements of b  -> rotate(&stack_b);
// rr : shift up both stacks        -> rotate(&stack_a); rotate(&stack_b);

// Reverse rotate operations
// rra : shift down all elements of a -> rev_rotate(&stack_a);
// rrb : shift down all elements of b -> rev_rotate(&stack_b);
// rrr : shift down both stacks        -> rev_rotate(&stack_a); rev_rotate(&stack_b);
