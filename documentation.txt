This is the 1st day working on push swap as a team mfakih and mitani.

This paper will document all the needed algorithms and
stategies needed to understand the push_swap project such that
you will be able to reinmplement it in your way.
I will cover the most important algorithms and how to do each one in theory 
which will be different than how you would go about it in code.

I will also use this opportuinity to document my own progress through this
project. Sharing my interpretation of the subject, the ideas i tried, the issues
i faced and how we came to solve it.

Each section will be titled with the date of that day and every subsection will clearly 
demonstrate the next task at hand we are working on.

Understanding the subject:
This is probably the most complicated part of any project, so we must go over it clearly to avoid
any future confusion. This part will also decide most if not all the approaches to go about this project.
