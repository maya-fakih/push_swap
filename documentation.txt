This is the 1st day working on push swap as a team mfakih and mitani.

This paper will document all the needed algorithms and
stategies needed to understand the push_swap project such that
you will be able to reinmplement it in your way.
I will cover the most important algorithms and how to do each one in theory 
which will be different than how you would go about it in code.

I will also use this opportuinity to document my own progress through this
project. Sharing my interpretation of the subject, the ideas i tried, the issues
i faced and how we came to solve it.

Each section will be titled with the date of that day and every subsection will clearly 
demonstrate the next task at hand we are working on.

Understanding the subject:
This is probably the most complicated part of any project, so we must go over it clearly to avoid
any future confusion. This part will also decide most if not all the approaches to go about this project.

After thorough reading of the subject I came to the following conclusions:
1. parsing string inputs to linked lists
2. the linked lists should be double sided why? well ig it can be useful later but we can start with one sided
3. set up proper add and delete functions to this linked  list
4. write the operations neatly
5. test these steps sepeately for leaks using valgrind
6. the algorithms are still work in process but i will attach a chat history of my mental warzones with gpt for reference
7. after all operations are done we need functions that clean up
8. they should free all lists and return a sungle string of operations seperated by \n only

Now tmrw is a new day and a new mind to think with for now have a great rest of the night.
i will see you in the morning. Goodnight.
